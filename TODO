- go through all of it, and make a new TODO list.


x trollop/highline cli module for minesweeper

- TESTS: Benchsweeper must have some coverage around at least public methods to prepare for refactoring
  - CellEntity: tests need to cover each method, but they're simple.
	- BoardEntity: need to cover each public method, also simple





- TESTS: Minesweeper went through significant updates/additions and needs tests everywhere

- Minesweeper Refactor: 
	
	- Render classes:
	  - are prepared for abstraction/refactor
		- make cell renderer more encapsulated
	
	- Game:
	  - extract terminal UI concerns
	  - update bin/minesweeper to use UI API
	
	- CLI: both use an almost identical CLI, figure out way to feed them the options

	DONE:

	- CellEntiity: looking pretty tight
	- BoardEntity: small refactors but otherwise tight
	- PointEntity/PositionEntity: lookin' good
	- Stats/Status: both lookin' good.
