- refactor solver into separate modules
- extract benchsweeper::play from script

  - CellEntity: tests need to cover each method, but they're simple.
	- BoardEntity: need to cover each public method, also simple

- TESTS: Minesweeper went through significant updates/additions and needs tests everywhere

- Minesweeper Refactor: 
	- CLI: both use an almost identical CLI, figure out way to feed them the options




DONE:
	
	- trollop/highline cli module for minesweeper

	- Render classes:
	  - are prepared for abstraction/refactor
		- make cell renderer more encapsulated
	
	- Game:
	  - extract terminal UI concerns
	  - update bin/minesweeper to use UI API
	- CellEntiity: looking pretty tight
	- BoardEntity: small refactors but otherwise tight
	- PointEntity/PositionEntity: lookin' good
	- Stats/Status: both lookin' good.

	- Tests:
		- Benchsweeper:
			- Cell
