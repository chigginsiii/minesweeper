TODO

- status tests
- coords tests, position tests
- change table tests to board tests
- update cell tests

- table => board
- cells => coord
- render: color?
- update CLI with new game api

DONE:

- moved defaults into Minesweeper
- change defaults in Minesweeper::Game/Board
- updated game entity with coords/position/status

- coord.get_cell board
- coord.put_cell board

- RECONSIDERED: game_entity => game (it's not an entity)
  - when use cases come into play, all entities give up logic to use cases. game is still an entity
