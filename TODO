* use cases: game = Minesweeper.new(rows, cols, mines)

	- generate new game 
	X (perhaps change "board" to "game")

	- flag cell: game.flag(r, c, callbacks)
		- flagged/unflagged: toggle state

	- reveal cell:
		- flagged: do nothing
		- is mine: boom
		- is not-touching: recursive reveal
		- is touching: reveal

	- game state:
		- game_status: new, running, won, lost
		- mines total / mines - flags out
		- board (draw): to spec, with rows / cols drawn

	- hook up to cmd line client:
		- start menu: q -> quit, space -> start
			- start: draw board, show mines/remains, menu:
				LOOP:
				- f(lag) [row] [col]
				- r(eveal) [row] [col]
				- q(uit)
				=> execute command
				=> update table
				=> draw board
				WON: display WON! space / q
				LOST: reveal whole board, space / q
				CONTINUE:
				=> continue LOOP

DONE: 

* key method: adjacent_cells()
	- Enumerable that takes a coord and turns it into:
	  top-left, top-center, top-right
	  left, right
	  bottom-left, bottom-right, bottom-center
	  r-1:c-1 r-1:c r-1:c+1
	  r:c-1         r:c+1
	  r+1:c-1 r+1:c r+1:c+1

* cell states:
